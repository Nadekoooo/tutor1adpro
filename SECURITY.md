# Security Policy

We take the security of our project seriously. We have **enabled private vulnerability reporting** in this repository. If you believe you have found a vulnerability or other security concern, please **do not disclose it publicly** until we have confirmed a fix or provided guidance.

## Reporting a Vulnerability

### 1. Private Vulnerability Reporting on GitHub

**Preferred Method**: 
1. Go to the [Security tab](../../security) of this GitHub repository.
2. Click **"Report a vulnerability"**.  
3. Fill out all relevant details (steps to reproduce, potential impact, etc.).  

We aim to respond to all private vulnerability reports **within 7 days** and work to fix confirmed vulnerabilities **within 30 days** (or 90 days for complex issues).

### 2. Alternate Reporting via Email

If GitHubâ€™s private reporting is not available or you prefer another method, you can reach us at:  
**[security@example.com](mailto:security@example.com)**

In your email, please include:
- Description of the vulnerability

## Disclosure Timeline

- We ask that you **disclose vulnerabilities responsibly**, giving us a chance to address the issue before making it public.
- We will coordinate with you on a public disclosure date. 
- In general, we aim to resolve or provide a fix for critical vulnerabilities **within 90 days** from initial report.

## Scope

- Vulnerabilities that could compromise user data, availability, or confidentiality are within scope.
- If you are not sure whether something is a vulnerability, please **report it anyway**; we are happy to take a look.
